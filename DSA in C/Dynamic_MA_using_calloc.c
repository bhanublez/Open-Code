//What is calloc?
// calloc() function is used to dynamically allocate multipel locks of memory.
// It is different from malloc in two wasys:
//calloc() needs two arguments instead of just of just one
//Syntax void *calloc(size_t n,size_t size);
//size_t--> Number of blocks
//size_t-->Size of each block
//*memory allocated by calloc is intialozed to zero 
//It is not the case with malloc. Memory allocated by malloc is intilialized garbage value
//It is  not case with mallooc.Memory allocated by malloc is intialized with some garbage value
//Note: malloc and calloc both return NULL when sufficient memory is not not available in the heap
//calloc stands for clear allocation while malloc stands for memory allocation
